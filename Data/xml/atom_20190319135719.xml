    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity to work with a bunch of TDD vim hackers during the last 4-5 months over at Nulogy, and after some initial resistance I decided to jump in and learn vim. My motivation is to really see if it lives up to the hype, and more importantly because it'll make me look like a genius to the layman watching my screen (I.e. <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com">Gary Bernhardt</a>).</p>

<p>I've tackled vim a few times over the years, but never fully committed to it. Since I believe you need to fully commit to something to do it well (including learning anything), I decided to pick up my touch typing first to really see the benefits of VIM.</p>

<p>Last week I achieved my typing goal of 75 words per minute, inspiration courtesy of <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Steve Yegge</a>. I've since upped my goal to 90 wpm, but I think I'm at least quick enough now to really immerse myself into learning vim.</p>

<p>I'm starting with <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i">Peepcode's Smash Into Vim</a>, this <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">Yehuda post</a>, and of course the built in vim tutor.</p>

<p>Rock on!</p>
