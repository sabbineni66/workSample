And bring her into the wilderness 
And speak tenderly to her 
And there I will give her, her vineyards 

The valley of Achor, the valley of Achor

And there she shall answer 
And there she shall answer 
As in the days of her youth 

And in that day says the Lord
You will call Me my husband 
And I will make you lie down in safety 
And I will betroth you to Me forever 

The valley of Achor, the valley of Achor 
Is the door of hope 
And there she shall answer 
And there she shall answer

I will betroth you to Me in righteousness 
And in justice, in steadfast love 
And in my mercy 
I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness

But ever, always, willingly, 
To serve Thee to the end. 

I cannot sing enough of Thee, 
The sweetest name on earth, 
A note so full of melody 
Comes from my heart so joyously, 
And fills my soul with mirth.

I have so much to tell:
Thy heart it beats so tenderly 
As thou dost draw me close to Thee, 
And whisper "All is well."</attribute>

As Judah?s lion takes the field. 

Laughing, weeping, dancing, singing,

This the long-awaited hour, 
This the day of heaven?s power 
This is the day of heaven?s power.

Feel the waters fast upwelling;

To obey Your one great command
To love my brother as You love me

When you came among us back in Gallilee
You were showing us Your Father's love
And You took our sins with you on Calvary's tree
Yes it's hard to lay down Your life

But I know in my soul You are making me whole
By Your grace You are changing my heart
And Your love I can feel, by Your spirit reveal 
That in you I can make a new start

I can start to love You like You want me to
To obey Your one great command
To love my brother as You love me
Yes I want to lay down my life

Come enter the land of His promise, 
Come eat of the corn and the wine:

See the pure gold He is bringing, 
And the raiment exceeding fine;
Our thanks we offer in singing, 
And the glory for ever be Thine. 
So, Lord, at they feet lowly bending, 
We take of thy gifts and thy love.  
We take of the grace Thou art sending

When purple morning breaketh
When the bird waketh 
And the shadows flee
Fairer than morning
Lovelier than daylight
Dawns the sweet consciousness
I am with Thee

Alone with Thee
Amid the mystic shadows
The solemn hush of nature newly born
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn

As in the dawning o'er the waveless ocean
The image of the morning star doth rest
So in the stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast

Still, still with Thee
As to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given
So does this blessed consciousness awaking
Breathe each day nearness
Unto Thee and heaven.

When sinks the soul 
Subdued by toil to slumber
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer
Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'er shading
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there

So shall it be at last
In that bright morning
When the soul waketh 
And life's shadows flee
O in that hour 
Fairer than daylight dawning
Shall rise the glorious thought
I am with Thee

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There?s a road that is open before us 
And it leads to a world unknown; 
Oft have we pondered its pleasures 
And pictured the heavenly throne. 

We have thought of myriad angels, 
Of harps and of jubilant song; 
We have pictured our Lord and our Saviour 
Where they praise Him all the day long. 

But now our heavenly Guide
Is taking us upward from earth, 
And we?re entering spiritual hallways 
With the sense of a spiritual birth. 

There?s a sensing of realms that we know not 
An acute awareness of need, 
To learn of the things of the Spirit, 
To sit at God?s table and feed. 

The Lamb whom we pictured we see not 
With the eyes of our flesh or our mind, 
But we sense His ineffable nearness 
As He opens the eyes of the blind. 

Instruct us, our God and our Father, 
As we move in this heavenly place;
Teach us the laws of the kingdom 
As we bathe in Thy glory and grace. 

Set our minds firmly on Jesus 
As we search for that radiant face; 
Let our feet go fervently forward 
As we seek for that uttermost place. 

Chorus
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Let the vaults of heaven ring, 
Let all nations come and worship 
At the throne of heaven?s king. 

Seek we now the joy of Jesus, 
Seek the deepest wells of life; 
Let us rise and take the kingdom, 
Rise victorious in the strife.</attribute>

See Him crowned with glory:  He is Lord of Life. 
Dark has been the midnight, dark the darkest hours 
When He went forth to conquer hell and all its powers. 

There on Calvary?s mountain and dread Gethsemane 
He fought the prince of darkness and won the victory. 
And now He reigns triumphant, the goodly crown is won. 
All glory to the Saviour, all glory to the Son.

When the clouds unfold their wings of strife

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand
For 'tis well secured by the Saviour's hand
And the cables passed from His heart to mine
Can defy the blast, through strength divine

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

It will firmly hold in the straits of fear
When the breakers have told the reef is near
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow
Not and angry wave shall our bark o'erflow

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

It will surely hold in the floods of death
When the waters cold, chill our latest breath
On the rising tide it can never fail
While our hopes abide within the veil

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love

When our eyes behold, through the gathering night
The city of gold, our harbour bright
We shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore
With the storms all past for evermore

All nations shall adore Him

Or dove's light wing can soar

He comes with succour speedy
To those who suffer wrong
To help the poor and needy
And bid the weak be strong
To give them songs for sighing
Their darkness turn to light
Whose souls, condemned and dying
Were precious in His sight

And make His paths straight in the wilderness
And let your light shine in the darkness
And let your rain fall in the desert.

As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet,
So you love this city and you love these streets.
Every child out playing by their own front door
Every baby laying on the bedroom floor.

Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job
Every driver driving through the rush hour mob
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

I can hear that thunder in the distance
Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
"Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down".

From the Preacher preaching when the well is dry
To the lost soul reaching for a higher high
From the young man working through his hopes and fears
To the widow walking through the veil of tears

Every man and woman, every old and young
Every fathers daughter, every mothers son.
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

I can hear that thunder in the distance
Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
"Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down".

Revive us with your fire!</attribute>

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There's a wideness in God's mercy 
I cannot find in my own 
And He keeps His fire burning 
To melt this heart of stone 
Keeps me aching with a yearning 
Keeps me glad to have been caught 
In the reckless raging fury 
That they call the love of God 

Now I've seen no band of angels 
But I've heard the soldiers' songs 
Love hangs over them like a banner 
Love within them leads them on 
To the battle on the journey 
And it's never gonna stop 
Ever widening their mercies 
And the fury of His love 

O the love of God 
O, the love of God 
The love of God 

Joy and sorrow are this ocean 
And in their every ebb and flow 
Now the Lord a door has opened 
That all Hell could never close 
Here I'm tested and made worthy 
Tossed about but lifted up 
In the reckless raging fury 
That they call the love of God

O the love of God 
O the love of God 
The love of God

I long to speak the grace that lifted me
I live to sound His praise from shore to shore
I live to serve Him only evermore

Jesus! of Thee I sing
Jesus! Thy praise shall fill my soul
Jesus! Thy joy be mine
Jesus! my heart shall love Thee forever
Jesus! always I'm thine

He is the hope of every contrite heart
He is the Way, the Comfort, Guide and Chart
Did ever such a Savior come before?
He only is the One I can adore

Jesus! I crown Thee conqueror
Jesus! of Thee I sing
Jesus! Thy praise shall fill my soul
Jesus! Thy joy be mine
Jesus! my heart shall love Thee forever

All earthly gain I gladly count but loss
To follow Him who died upon the Cross
His love is so amazing, yet so sure
It will for countless ages aye endure

Jesus! Thou art my victory
Jesus! Thou art my king
Jesus! I crown Thee conqueror
Jesus! of Thee I sing
Jesus! Thy praise shall fill my soul
Jesus! Thy joy be mine
Jesus! my heart shall love Thee forever

The day will dawn when all my conflicts o'er
I shall inherit rest on that sweet shore
My lord shall show the victor's glowing crown

This is my anthem, this is my song

God has been faithful, He will be again 
His loving compassion, it knows no end 
All I have need of, His hand will provide 
He?s always been faithful, He?s always been faithful

So they knew from the start
This road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them
He said "Come follow me" and they came
With reckless abandon they came

Empty nets lying there at the waters edge
Told a story that few could believe and none could explain
How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus lead
With no thought for what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name and they answered

[Chorus:]
We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die
For the sake of the call

Drawn like the rivers are drawn to the sea
No turning back for the water cannot help but flow
Once we hear the Savior's call we'll follow wherever he leads
Because of the love He has shown
And because he has called us to go we will answer

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die

[Bridge:]
Not for the sake of a creed or a cause
Not for a dream or a promise
Simply because it is Jesus who calls
And if we believe we'll obey

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die
For the sake of the call</attribute>

And heaven and nature sing x 3 

Joy to the earth 
The Saviour reigns 
Your sweetest songs employ 
While fields and floods
Rocks hill and plains 
Repeat the sounding joy x 3 

He rules the world 
With truth and grace 
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of His righteousness 
The wonders of His love x 3

It is the night of our dear Saviour?s birth 
Long lay the world in sin and darkness pining
Till He appeared gift of infinite worth 
Behold the babe in yonder manger lowly 
'Tis God's own Son come down in human form
Fall on your knees behold the Lord most Holy 

O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine 

With humble hearts we bow in adoration 
Before this Child gift of God's matchless love 
Sent from on high to purchase our salvation 
That we might dwell with Him ever above 
What grace untold to leave the bliss of glory 
And die for sinners guilty and forlorn 
Fall on your knees repeat the wondrous story 

O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine 

O day of Joy when in eternal splendour 
He shall return in His glory to reign 
When every tongue due praise to Him shall render 
His power and might to all nations proclaim 
A thrill of hope the longing heart rejoices 
For soon shall dawn that glad eternal morn 
Fall on your knees with joy lift up your voices

Where my faith and real life meet
Sometimes hope seems out of reach
I hear the growing cry for freedom
Am I equal to the call?
Where's the love that conquers all?
It's so easy to be human, so human to give in
But when I reach beyond my weakness
I'm reminded once again

The power is still where it's always been
The Word is alive, Jesus still lives
The power of His blood
Hasn't lessened or dimmed
It's where it's always been
It's where it's always been

Where's the passion for the mission?
Where's the fervour of our faith?
Where's the evidence of grace?
Where's the love that finds compassion
In the sea of human need?
Where's the truth that sets men free?
In a world that holds no answer
Every heart will someday find
That everything they long for
Has been there all the time

The power is still where it's always been
The Word is alive, Jesus still lives
The power of His blood
Hasn't lessened or dimmed
It's where it's always been
It's where it's always been

There's a reason to believe
There's an empty grave that's calling out to me</attribute>

See the Lamb of God appears

Hail redemption?s happy dawn

Lo within a manger lies 
He who built the starry skies 
He who throned in height sublime 
Sits amid the cherubim 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn

What your joyful news to-day 
Wherefore have ye left your sheep

Hail redemption?s happy dawn

As we watched at dead of night 
Lo we saw a wondrous light 
Angels singing peace on earth 
Told us of the Saviour?s birth 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn

What a tender love was Thine 
Thus to come from highest bliss

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by 
Yet in the dark streets shineth
The everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight 

O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth 
For Christ is born of Mary 
And gathered all above 
While mortals sleep the angels keep 
Their watch of wondering love 

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given 
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven 
No ear may hear His coming 
But in this world of sin 
Where meek souls will receive Him 
Still the dear Christ enters in 

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray 
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today 
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell 
O come to us abide with us

My richest gain I count but loss

Forbid it Lord that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e?er such love and sorrow meet ,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

And there have I, though vile as he

I do believe I will believe

From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
That on the cross He shed His blood 
From sin to set me free 

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more.

E?er since, by faith, I saw the stream

Redeeming love has been my theme

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">When we're young and free as a bird 
And life lies before us 
Like an unexplored adventure 
Time seems like a promise 
That we hold within our hand 
But we rarely understand 

That time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

To live to love we set our goals 
Never to be chained 
But be blown by winds of fancy 
Freedom is our promise 
And we hold it in our hand 
But we're building on the sand 

For time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

'Till a high and holy call 
Falls on our cherished youthful days
And we realise that time is slipping by 
Fading into misted memory 
While Jesus stands and whispers 
Follow me, follow me

And time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away

Some sleeping sheep lie still 
A quiet calm a holy hush 
To fall on that lonely hill 

Breaking heaven's glory
Calling into the night 
Softly shining of starlight
Holy glory of light 

An angel voice a holy light
A song of peace on earth 
The Son has come the joyful news 
To us is born the King 

Singing songs of heaven
Shouting "Glory to God"
Dancing heaven rejoicing
Creation welcomes the Son

Glory hallelujah 
Glory Glory to God 
Glory in the highest 
Glory Glory to God

Rich the trophies Jesus brings
In the seat of power enthrone Him
While the vault of heaven rings

Crown the Saviour, King of kings!

Sinners in derision crowned Him
Mocking thus the Saviour's claim
Saints and angels throng around Him
Own His title, praise His name
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Spread abroad the Victor's fame.

Hark those burst of acclamation
Hark those loud triumphant chords

Onward I march, to a burning far horizon
Carrying a cross, Carrying a cross

Always keep the fire alive

How can I stay when the fire is moving onwards
Cling to this earth, when all heaven waits ahead
Strong is the call, and the king demands an answer

Broken for you
And as long as you eat it
Remember me

Given for you

This wine I take it is poured out
Poured out for you
And as long as you drink it
Remember me
For it is my very blood shed
Blood shed for you
I'll not drink of this wine

That Christ has chosen you and me
To be the revelation of His glory
A chosen, royal, holy people
Set apart and love
A Bride preparing for her King.

Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride of the Lamb say come Lord Jesus
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride of the Lamb say come Lord Jesus come

She's crowned in splendour
And a royal diadem
The King is enthralled by her beauty
Adorned in righteousness
Arrayed in glorious light
The bride in waiting for her King.

Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride of the Lamb say come Lord Jesus
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride of the Lamb say come Lord Jesus come

Now hear the Bridegroom call
Beloved come aside
The time of betrothal is at hand
Lift up your eyes and see 
The dawning of the day
When as King I'll return to claim my bride

Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride of the Lamb say come Lord Jesus
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride say come
Let the Bride of the Lamb say come Lord Jesus come</attribute>

Because I know I know

And life is worth the living

And then one day I'll cross the river 
I'll fight life's final war with pain 
And then as death gives way to vict'ry

All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride,

Who triumphed o'er the grave 
And rose victorious in the strife

His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high 
Who died eternal life to bring 
And lives that death may die 

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side 
Those wounds yet visible above 
In beauty glorified 
No angel in the sky 
Can fully bear that sight 
But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways 
From pole to pole that wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise 
His reign shall know no end 
And round His pierced feet 
Fair flowers of paradise extend 
Their fragrance ever sweet 

Crown Him the Lord of years 
The Potentate of time 
Creator of the rolling spheres
Ineffably sublime 
All hail Redeemer hail

Thy praise shall never, never fail

Ev'n that same Lord that great in might 
And strong in battle is 

Ye gates lift up your heads ye doors 
Doors that do last for aye 
Be lifted up that so the King 
Of glory enter may 

Men: But who is He that is the King 
Women: The King of Glory Who is this 

The Lord of Hosts and none but He 
The King of Glory is 
The Lord of Hosts and none but He 
The King of Glory is

When sorrow like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say

Though Satan should buffet 
If trials should come 
Let this blest assurance control 
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

My sin - O the bliss of this glorious thought 
My sin not in part but the whole 
Is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more 
Praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord O my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

For me be it Christ be it Christ hence to live 
If Jordan above me shall roll 
No pang shall be mine for in death as in life 
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

But Lord, 'tis for Thee
For Thy coming we wait 
The sky not the grave is our goal
O trump of the angel O voice of the Lord
Blessed hope blessed rest of my soul

And the melody, that He gives to me
Within my heart is ringing.

For joy to the living God
How lovely is Thy dwelling place 
O Lord of hosts to me.

Even the sparrow finds a home 
Where he can settle down
And the swallow she can build a nest 
Where she may lay her young
Within the courts of the Lord of hosts, 
My king my Lord and my God
And happy are those who are dwelling 
Where the song of praise is sung

I'd rather be a door-keeper and only stay a day
Than live the life of a sinner and have to stay away
For the Lord is shining as the sun 
And the Lord He's like a shield
And no good things does He withhold 
From those who walk His way</attribute>

You'll find Jesus
He's the only one who cares and understands
Standing somewhere in the shadows
You will find Him
And you'll know Him
By the nail-prints in His hands

Always waiting in the shadows
You'll find Jesus
He's the one who stays when others go away
Always waiting in the shadows
You will find Him
And you'll know Him
By the nail-prints in His hands

Can you wonder?
Can you wonder?
Can you wonder
Why it is I love Him so?
When I think of all He's done
And for me, the guilty one
Can you wonder
Why it is I love Him so?

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever I am.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed, His child and forever I am.

Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed, His child and forever I am.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long:
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed, His child and forever I am.

I know I shall see in His beauty,
The King in whose law I delight,
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed, His child and forever I am.													
I know there's a crown that is waiting,
In yonder bright mansion for me,
And soon, with the spirits made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed, His child and forever I am.</attribute>

That my beloved's mine and I am His

But chiefly Thine 
That through Thy sacrifice
Thou Lord art mine
By Thine own cords of love so sweetly wound
Around me I to Thee am closely bound

To Thee, Thou dying Lamb 
I all things owe
All that I have and am
And all I know
All that I have is now no longer mine
And I am not my own, Lord I am Thine

How can I Lord withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee or gathered gold
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee
When Thou hast given Thine own dear self for me

I pray Thee Saviour keep
Me in thy love
Until death's holy sleep
Shall me remove
To that fair realm where, sin and sorrow o'er
Thou and Thine own are one for evermore

Mould Thou this life into a vessel fair

Thy living thought 
I would not give to hungry souls the words
That man hath taught 
Shall they who seek for bread a stone receive?
It is God?s Word alone that can relieve

How wonderful a channel thus to be 
To those forlorn 
A messenger of peace and joy and hope 
To them that mourn 
O grant that I Thy risen life may share 
The virtue of Thy name to others bear 

Under th?anointing daily let me live 
A priest and king 
Relying not on fleshly energy 
Thy smile to win 
A simple soul in contact with my Lord 
In whom all fullness is forever stored 

O teach me Lord henceforth with Thee to walk 
In union deep 
Whilst tending other souls not to neglect 
My own to keep 
A separated soul unto the One 
Whose grace and love for me so much have done.

Shall then be raised in power
And the songs of the blood-bought millions
Shall hail that blissful hour

And night's dark shadows fly

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">O what a wonderful, wonderful day
A day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my saviour I met
O, what a tender compassionate Friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine
Justified fully thro' Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me O praise His dear name

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My Saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

In Your presence, O Lord my God
In Your presence, that's where I belong

I want to go, where the rivers cannot overflow me
Where my feet are on the rock
I want to hide where the blazing fire cannot burn me

I want to hide where the flood of evil cannot reach me
Where I'm covered by the blood
I want to be where the schemes of darkness cannot touch me

I trust in You all day long
I am Your child and Your servant
And You are my strength
And my song, You're my song

We have prayed to You for rain
We have cried for Your compassion
To renew the land again
Now we're standing in Your presence 
More hungry than before
Now we're on the steps of mercy
And we're knocking at Your door.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

Lord we know Your heart is broken
By the evil that You see
And you've stayed Your hand of judgement
For You plan to set men free.
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
We have failed the silent children
Who will never see the light.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear His voice
When the blind will see their Saviour
And the lame will leap for joy.
When the widow finds a Husband
Who will always love His bride
And the orphan finds a Father
Who will never leave her side. 

How long, before Your glory lights the skies?
How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
How long, before Your fragrance fills the air?
How long, before the earth resounds with songs of joy?

Face to face in all His glory

What rejoicing in His presence
When are banished grief and pain
When the crooked ways are straightened
And the dark things shall be plain

Face to face shall I behold Him
Far beyond the starry sky
Face to face in all His glory
I shall see Him by and by

Face to face!
O blissful moment
Face to face?
To see and know
Face to face with my Redeemer
Jesus Christ who loves me so

Beyond your fear
Only the Father goes before you
To your own frontier
You're a pioneer

Uncharted wilderness streches before you
And you thrive on going where no one has gone
Still it gets lonely when the darkness deepens
So sing by the fire until the dawn

Pioneer, pioneer
Keep pressing onward
Beyond your fear
Only the Father goes before you
To your own frontier
You're a pioneer

You travel light, you travel alone
And when you arrive, nobody knows
But the Father in heaven, He's glad you can go
For those who come after you will need the road

Pioneer, pioneer
Keep pressing onward
Beyond your fear
Only the Father goes before you
To your own frontier
You're a pioneer

What you have done, others will do
Bigger and better, and faster than you
But you can't look back, no you gotta keep pressing through
There's a wilderness pathway, and it's calling you

Calling you, calling you clear
Keep pressing onward, you can't stay here
Only the Father goes before you
To your own frontier
You're a pioneer!</attribute>

Fixed on the Lamb who was crucified

Who was slain for the world rule in power"
And the earth will reply "You shall reign 
As the King of all kings and the Lord of all Lords"

There's a shield in our hand 
And a sword at our side 
There's a fire in our spirit 
That cannot be denied 
As the Father has told us 
For these You have died 
For the nations that gather before You 
And the ears of all men need to hear 
Of the Lamb who was crucified 
Who descended to hell yet was raised up 
To reign at the Father's side

I've heard them say, that morning, that the earth began to shake
And that the light that filled the garden also filled an empty grave
I've heard it said, He's risen from the dead
Repeat

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven
As we wait for Him to come again some day
The people say, He is alive

Come one and all to wonder at the grave they laid Him in
Come see the tomb is empty, He has triumphed over sin
The power of death has been defeated and forgiven now we sing
O hear us sing, He's risen from the dead

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven
As we wait for Him to come again some day
The people say He is alive

Beaten, rejected, crucified
Scorned and afflicted
Left to die
Risen, victorious, King of life
Saviour, Redeemer, Jesus Christ

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven
As we wait for Him to come again some day

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">On the Cross crucified, 
In great sorrow He died:
The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised 
And rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid, 
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all. 
This wonderful Healer's mine.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying, "Surely I know
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said, "Yes, I will,"
And touched him and made him clean.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

He has healed my sick soul, made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Seal it for Thy courts above.

For me it was in the garden
He prayed not My will, but Thine
He had no fears for His own griefs
But sweat drops of blood for mine

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows 
He bore for my soul that night

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'Twill be  my joy through the ages

Sing it with the saints in glory,

Rolls its waters at my feet;

Where the loved ones I shall meet.

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Since the day the angel came
It seemed that everything had changed
The only certain thing 
Was the child that moved within
On the road that would not end
Winding down to Bethlehem
So far away from home

Just a blanket on the floor
Of that vacant cattle stall
But there the child was born
She held Him in her arms
And as she laid Him down to sleep
She wondered will it always be
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

And as she watched Him through the years
Her joy was mingled with her tears
And she?d feel it all again 
The glory and the pain
And when the miracles began
She wondered Who is this Man
And where will this all end

Then the words of ancient seers 
Echoed down the centuries
A virgin shall conceive
God with us, Prince of Peace
Man of sorrow strangest name
She wondered time and time again
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

 ?Till against a darkened sky 
The Son she loved was lifted high 
And with His dying breath 
She heard Him say ?Father forgive?
And to the criminal beside 
?Today with me in Paradise?
So bitter yet so sweet

Cleanse your heart and your soul
In the fountain that flows
For you and for me and for all

At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful scandalous night

On the hillside you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And your spirit restored
By the river that pours
From our blessed Saviour?s side

How pure the soul must be
When, placed within Thy searching sight
It shrinks not, but, with calm delight
Can live, and look on Thee

The spirits that surround Thy throne
May bear the burning bliss
But that is surely theirs alone
Since they have never, never known
A fallen world like this

O how shall I, whose native sphere
Is dark, whose mind is dim
Before the Ineffable appear
And on my naked spirit bear
The uncreated beam?

There is a way for man to rise
To that sublime abode
An offering and a sacrifice
A Holy Spirit's energies
An advocate with God

These, these prepare us for the sight
Of Holiness above
The sons of ignorance and night
May dwell in the eternal light
Through the eternal Love

His face is shining like the sun
With eyes blazing fire
And feet glowing bronze
His voice like mighty waters roars

Holy holy we stand in awe of You

The first the last the living One
Laid down His life for all the world
Behold He now lives forever more
And holds the keys of death and hell
Holy holy Lord God Almighty
Holy holy we bow before Your throne

So let our praises ever ring
To Jesus Christ our glorious King
All heaven and earth resound as we cry

And they went to Africa
To escape the rage of a deadly king
There along the banks of the Nile
Jesus listened to the song
That the captive children used to sing

Through a dry and thirsty land
Water for the Kenyan heights
Pours itself out of lake Sanquwas broken heart
There in the Sahara winds 
Jesus heard the whole word cry
For the healing that would flow from His own scars

The world was singing

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x2

He will never break his promise
He has written it upon the sky

My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by x2

I will never doubt his promise
Though I doubt my heart
Though I doubt my eyes

Though the stars should break faith with the sky

Above all wealth

Crucified laid behind the stone

An interest in the Saviour's blood?

Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou my God shouldst die for me?

Tis Mystery all! The Immortal dies
Who can explore His strange design? 
In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine! 
Tis mercy all! Let earth adore
Let angel minds inquire no more 

He left His Father's throne above 
So free so infinite His grace! 
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race 
Tis mercy all, immense and free
For O my God it found out me! 

Long my imprisoned spirit lay 
Fast bound in sin and nature's night 
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray 
I woke the dungeon flamed with light 
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee 

No condemnation now I dread

Alive in Him my living head
And clothed in righteousness divine 
Bold I approach the eternal throne

And myrrh their texture fills
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine
With joy my being thrills

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

His life had also its sorrow sore
For aloes had a part
And when I think of the cross He bore
My eyes with tear drops start

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

His garments too were in cassia dipped
With healing in a touch
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped
He took me from its clutch

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

In garments glorious He will come 
To open wide the door
And I shall enter my heavn'ly home
To dwell for ever more

Hark to the sounding trumpet, hark to the blaring horn

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
Tis grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

Yes when this heart and flesh shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise

By the blood of Jesus 
A life of sin washed clean away 
By the blood of Jesus 

Who would have thought 
I'd ever know God's own love
For my very own 

Born to die we live instead 
By the blood of Jesus 
A life of sin washed clean away 
By the blood of Jesus 

There is power 
In His precious blood 
To overcome the evil one
 
Born to die we live instead
By the blood of Jesus 
A life of sin washed clean away 
By the blood of Jesus

I faced the power of sin on my own 
I did not know of a place 
Where I could go 
Where I could find a way 
To heal my wounded soul 

He said that I could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near
 
I'm running, I'm running 
I'm running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
He said His grace would cover me 
His blood will flow freely 
It will provide the healing 
I'm running to the mercy seat 
I'm running to the mercy seat

Are you living where hope has not been 
Lost in the curse of a lifetime of sin 
Lovely illusions they never come true 
I know where there's a place 
Of mercy for you 

He said that you could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near 

Come running, come running 
Come running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
His grace will be a covering 
His blood will flow freely

Now clothed with immortality
Death has now been 
Swallowed up in victory

And we'll be with Him forever
And in His glory we will live

Though trouble's hard
It's only momentary
And it's achieving
Our future glory.

We will meet Him in the air

Whilst in Thy presence humbly we bow
Set all our hearts ablaze with Thy love
Teach us the secret of life from above

Raise up a people, holy and free
Hearts with a vision like unto Thee
Souls that would rather die than give in 
Lives with a passion, victory to win

Spirit divine O quicken us now
Whilst in Thy presence humbly we bow
Set all our hearts ablaze with Thy love
Teach us the secret of life from above

O for deluge, Holy Ghost power
Lord we are waiting, send it this hour
Open the windows of heaven we pray
All on the altar gladly we lay

Spirit divine O quicken us now
Whilst in Thy presence humbly we bow
Set all our hearts ablaze with Thy love
Teach us the secret of life from above</attribute>

Still we are a voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes 
Riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun 
At the trumpet call 
Lift your voice the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill 
Salvation comes 

These are the days of Ezekiel 
The dry bones becoming as flesh 
And these are the days
Of your servant David 
Rebuilding the temple of praise 
And these are the days of the harvest 
The fields are as white in your world 
And we are the labourers 
In your vineyard 
Declaring the word of the Lord

Behold He comes 
Riding on the clouds

Lift your voice the year of jubilee

On any shore, since God is there.

While place we seek, or place we shun,
The soul finds happiness in none;
But, with my God to guide our way,
'Tis equal joy to go or stay.

Could I be cast where Thou art not,
That were indeed a dreadful lot;
But regions none remote I call,
Secure of finding God in all.</attribute>

He is my light my strength my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I stand.</attribute>

But through suffering death and sorrow

Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Yes, He is with God, the Father,

For He is the Mighty Conqueror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror,

Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved,

Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror,

Sat the Ark of the Covenant 
Where the Most High dwells 
But only the high priest could enter therein 
To offer up a sacrifice of atonement for sin 
But the veil was rent in an instant 
Revealing the holy place 
On a hill nearby on a rugged cross 
Justice met grace 

Now I can go into the Holy of holies 
I can kneel and make my petition known 
I can go into the Holy of holies
And although I'm just a common man 
Because of God's redemption plan 
I can boldly approach the throne 

For the blood of sacrifices 
Is now no longer required 
For the blood of Christ God's spotless Lamb 
Has opened heaven's door 
Allowing us to enter in
To the presence of the Lord

A river of blessing a river of love 
Tis reaching the nations both far and near
This river of God O let it flow here 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The desert shall blossom as fresh as the rose 
This river brings healing wherever it flows 
The ground that is parched so thirsty and dry 
Shall surely be flooded with rain from on high 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The deaf shall have hearing 
The blind folk shall see 
The lame shall be loosed from their infirmity 
The crooked made straight 
And the broken made whole 
This latter time blessing as promised by Joel 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The fetters of fear and of doubt soon shall break 
When unbelief goes and the church shall awake 
The chains of hard bondage forever will fall 
And Jesus exalted supreme over all 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

By this flowing river earth's bondage shall cease 
The floods are now rising to bring us release 
The vision is glorious then why not believe
Step into the blessing His fullness receive

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

In an upper room 
Waiting for God's power 
From on high 
They were waiting for a promise
Made not so long before 
Jesus said He'd come  
And set their souls on fire 
Suddenly the sound of wind came rushing in 
And their hearts were set aflame 
And to them He gave the power
When they called upon His name 

Suddenly, I can feel 
His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again 
You can find all you need at the altar 
Leave behind every weight that presses in 
For the Spirit of the Lord 
Is still moving suddenly 

Never let your heart be troubled
No need to be afraid 
When you feel you don't have
Strength to carry on 
There is glory in God's presence
There is healing in His love 
He's our anchor and our peace in every storm 
So my friend call on the Lord 
And trust His word 
From age to age He's still the same 
For He's a God who loves us
A God who hears us 
There's power in His name 

Suddenly, I can feel 
His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again

The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for
The fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O Christ, He is the fountain
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above:
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
In Immanuel's land.

With mercy and with judgment 
My web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
Were lustered by His love;
I'll bless the hand that guided
I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O I am my Beloved's 
And my Beloved is mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
Into His "house of wine".
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand,
Not even where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The Bride eyes not her garment
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land

I've wrestled on towards Heaven
Against storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening
While sinks life's lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

You became nothing poured out to death
Many times I've wondered at your gift of life
And I'm in that place once again
I'm in that place once again.

And once again I look upon 
The cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You,
Once again I pour out my life

Now You are exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow
But for now I marvel at Your saving grace
And I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again.

And once again I look upon 
The cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy
And I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You,
Once again I pour out my life</attribute>

Loving kindness as the flood
When the Prince of life, our ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten
Throughout heaven's eternal days

On the Mount of Crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide
Grace and love like mighty rivers
Poured incessant from above
And heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love

In Thy truth Thou dost direct me
By Thy Spirit through Thy word
And Thy Grace my need is meeting
As I trust in Thee my Lord
All Thy fulness Thou art pouring
In Thy Love and Power in me
Without measure full and boundless 
As I yield myself to Thee.

Let me all Thy love accepting
Love Thee ever all my days
Let me seek Thy kindom only
And my life be to thy praise
Thou alone shall be my glory
Nothing in this world I see
Thou has cleansed and sanctified me
Thou thyself hAS Set me free

Chiefest of all unto Thy bride
Fullness Divine in Thee I see 
Wonderful Man of Calvary

That Man of Calvary 
Has won my heart from me
And died to set me free 
Blest Man of Calvary

Granting the sinner life and peace 
Granting the captive sweet release
Shedding His blood to make us free 
Merciful Man of Calvary

That Man of Calvary 
Has won my heart from me
And died to set me free 
Blest Man of Calvary

Giving the gifts obtained for men
Pouring out love beyond our ken 
Giving us spotless purity 
Bountiful Man of Calvary 

That Man of Calvary 
Has won my heart from me
And died to set me free 
Blest Man of Calvary

Comfort of all my earthly way 
Jesus I'll meet Thee some sweet day 
Centre of glory Thee I'll see 
Wonderful man of Calvary

With the crucified
Temples of the Spirit
Saved and sanctified
Set apart for service
By God's hand ordained
We the cross have taken
By His love constrained

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Christ the veil has entered 
With the blood He shed
Sin's great debt is cancelled
Love's own feast is spread
Now in Christ we're chosen 
Kings and priests to be
Living offerings bringing 
His own blood our plea

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Like a boundless ocean 
Ever rolling in
Comes this flood of blessing
Seeking lives to win
Who such love can fathom 
From God's heart which flows
Or such grace e'er measure
Which His hand bestows

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Pressing onward upward
Life grows pure and strong
Tis the vision splendid 
Saves from all that's wrong
In the steps of Jesus 
We would plant our own
Blessed path of triumph 
Leading to the throne

Step by step with Jesus 
All along life's way
Now the cross and conflict 
Then the perfect day

Cannot now disturb my rest 
Closed in everlasting arms
Pillowed on the loving breast
O to lie for ever here
Doubt and care and self resign 
While He whispers in my ear
I am His and He is mine

His for ever only His 
Who the Lord and me shall part 
Ah with what a rest of bliss

Firstborn light in gloom decline

No fragrant morning noon or dappled ev'ning
Compare in any facet with the Son

Redeemed Thine own creation with Thy blood 
Restoring man belov'd of God the Father 
Reviled and placed upon a cross of wood 

Now have I seen Thee in the sanctu'ry 
O God most high more dear than any one 
Resplendent Lord surpassing thought or concept
Receive the sacrifice of Thine own Son 

Within these walls of time we live and move 
Receding limits as we gaze on Thee 
For through the flesh of our imperfect being 
There breaketh knowledge of Eternity 

So shall I praise Thee love Thee and adore
Till life is through and limits lose their hold 
And standing there at last alone before Thee 
My praises shall for ever more unfold

Should set His love upon the sons of men 
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back they know not how or when 
But this I know that He was born of Mary 
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home 
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured 
And so the Saviour
Saviour of the world is come 

I cannot tell how silently He suffered 
As with His peace he graced this place of tears 
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken 
The crown of pain to three and thirty years 
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted 
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear 
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden 
For yet the Saviour 
Saviour of the world is here 

I cannot tell how He will win the nations 
How He will claim His earthly heritage 
How satisfy the needs and aspirations 
Of east and west of sinner and of sage 
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory 
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown 
And some glad day 
His sun shall shine in splendour 
When He the Saviour
Saviour of the world is known 

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship 
When at His bidding every storm is stilled 
Or who can say how great the jubilation 
When all the hearts of men with love are filled 
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture 
And myriad myriad human voices sing 
And earth to heaven 
And heaven to earth will answer

Saviour of the world is King!" </attribute>

Sing we now our glad refrain. 

Take the things that shade His glory:
Pierce the clouds that lie between; 
Convict of sin, O Holy Spirit, 
That His glory may be seen. 

Come, Holy Spirit, to release us: 
Bind our wounds and set us free; 
Break the cruel bands of darkness, 
As Thy glorious light we see. 

Lift the burdens, Holy Spirit: 
Heal the scars and staunch the pain, 
By the precious blood of Jesus,
Through the Lamb who once was slain. 

Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Praise we now the stricken Lamb;
Unctioned by the Holy Spirit,

As we fought the angry sea 
Until He arose and all was peace 

And suddenly peace and calm 
Suddenly still my heart began to see 
And suddenly holy light
Shining like sun so bright 
Suddenly peace 
Suddenly calm 
Suddenly Christ

I whispered to the others 
Who is this righteous man 
That the sea in all its anger 
Dies away at His command 
We would have died there 
As we fought the angry sea 
Until He arose and all was peace 

And suddenly peace and calm 
Suddenly still my heart began to see 
And suddenly holy light
Shining like sun so bright 
Suddenly peace 
Suddenly calm 
Suddenly Christ

Suddenly peace 
Suddenly calm 
Suddenly Christ

Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
Take my moments and my days;
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands, and let them move 
At the impulse of Thy love.
Take my feet, and let them be 
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing 
Always, only, for my King.
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold; 
Not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine;  
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart, it is Thine own;  
It shall be Thy royal throne.
                
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever only all for Thee.

Heaven and earth will pass away

Sound the trumpet

He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Conscious now of earthly things
'Till we see the King of Kings
Such a long time so it seemed
Now hear the song of the redeemed

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

In this day in which we stand
We cry out from every land
Songs of triumph
Songs of love
One day we will sing above

Sound the trumpet

And I will trust Him at all times
He has delivered me from all fear
He has set my feet upon a rock
And I will not be moved
And I'll say of the Lord

You are my shield, my strength 
My portion, deliverer 
My shelter, strong tower
My very present help in times of need

Whom have I in heaven but You?
There is none I desire beside You
You have made me glad
And I'll say of the Lord

You are my shield, my strength 
My portion, deliverer 
My shelter, strong tower
My very present help in times of need</attribute>

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">'Tis the Church triumphant singing  
Worthy the Lamb 
Heav'n throughout with praises ringing 
Worthy the Lamb 
Thrones and pow'rs before Him bending 
Odours sweet with voice ascending 
Swell the chorus never ending
Worthy the Lamb 

Every kindred tongue and nation 
Worthy the Lamb 
Join to sing the great salvation 
Worthy the Lamb 
Loud as mighty thunders roaring 
Floods of mighty waters pouring 
Prostrate at His feet adoring
Worthy the Lamb 

Harps and songs for ever sounding 
Worthy the lamb 
Mighty grace o'er sin abounding 
Worthy the Lamb 
By His blood He dearly bought us 
Wand'ring from the fold He sought us 
And to glory safely brought us
Worthy the Lamb

Sing with blest anticipation 
Worthy the Lamb 
Through the vale of tribulation 
Worthy the Lamb 
Sweetest notes all notes excelling 
On the theme for ever dwelling 
Still untold though ever telling
Worthy the Lamb

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Jesus is returning like a thief in the night
He told us all we shall not know 
The seasons or the times
He just said we must be ready
For there'll be no place to hide
Make straight the paths of righteousness
And shine your light

Face to face all of creation shall be
Face to face with the light of the world
Face to face every nation shall see
Jesus face to face

And so we shall see Jesus
And all the ones who've gone before
So great a cloud of witnesses
Coming with the Lord
The poor and the afflicted
The needy and the hurt
The lowly and the humble
Shall inherit all the earth

And for everyone who called in vain
While injustice raised its head
For the ones who cried in hunger
And yet could not be fed
There shall come a new beginning
They shall all be glorified
When the ruined sinners
By His blood are standing by His side

Face to face all of creation shall be
Face to face with the light of the world
Face to face every nation shall see
Jesus face to face</attribute>

We go not forth alone against the foe;
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.

Yes, in Thy Name, O Captain of salvation!
In Thy dear Name, all other names above;
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
Our Prince of glory and our King of love.
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
Our Prince of glory and our King of love.

We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,
And needing more each day Thy grace to know:
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing,
?We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.?
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing,
?We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.?

We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!
Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise;
When passing through the gates of pearly splendor,
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.
When passing through the gates of pearly splendour,
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.</attribute>

A throne of great renown
Where men have come to worship
Upon this holy ground
And this oil has not departed
Nor the meal to feed the young
But the Lord has spoken clearly
Of the glory yet to come

And now rolling like a river
Ever deep and ever wide
Shining bright from out of Heaven
Comes a living crystal tide

See the fire on the horizon
Burning holy in the night
See the King of all of Heaven
Striding swiftly to the fight

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Jesus is the Lord of all 
Jesus is the Lord of all
Jesus is the Lord of all 
We have been redeemed
