<p>William Strunk, Jr. (July 1, 1869, Cincinnati, Ohio ? September
26, 1946, Ithaca, New York) was Professor of English at Cornell
University and is best known as the author of the first editions of
The Elements of Style, a best-selling guide to English usage. This
book, printed as a private edition in 1918 for the use of his
students, became a classic on the local campus, known as "the
little book", and its successive editions have since sold over ten
million copies. In his first edition, Strunk describes the book as
follows: "It aims to lighten the task of instructor and student by
concentrating attention&#160;? on a few essentials, the rules of
usage and principles of composition most commonly violated." This
original was revised in 1935 by Strunk and Edward A. Tenney and
published under the title The Elements and Practice of Composition.
After Strunk's death, it was again revised by E. B. White, an
editor at The New Yorker who had been one of Strunk's students.
This 1959 edition of The Elements of Style (often referred to as
simply Strunk &amp; White) became a companion to millions of
American writers and college freshmen. Strunk earned his bachelor's
degree at the University of Cincinnati in 1890, and Ph.D. at
Cornell University in 1896. While he taught English at Cornell for
forty-six years, the only other book Strunk wrote was English
Metres (published locally in 1922). Better known as an editor,
Strunk edited important works by authors including William
Shakespeare, John Dryden, and James Fenimore Cooper. He served as
literary consultant to the 1936 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of
Romeo and Juliet. Strunk married Olivia Emilie Locke in 1900, and
they had two sons and a daughter.</p>
