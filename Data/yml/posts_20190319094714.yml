- :title: a new beginning
  :text: |
    It's time to start over.
    
    I've been negligent with the regularity of my posts, but I think I know
    why.
    
    It was the pressure of trying to fill the page.
    
    Instead of simply posting any small thought that I had, I tried to
    construct massive posts of some "value". So... as part of building this new
    site, more to come on that, I've changed to a different format for the
    blog. I think the new style, more of a stream of posts than one-at-a-time,
    should be more conducive to posting **something**.
