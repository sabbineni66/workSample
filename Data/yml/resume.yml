mission_statement: "I am looking for an exciting Ruby position where I can make a difference. I am looking to learn and be challenge while continuing to improve my development skills. Personally, I enjoy getting projects out to production for real world use. I work best with small focused teams who release early and often. I enjoy working with clients, customers, and/or users to drive the needs of a product and am increasingly interested in applying lean principles to development. I am currently searching to work with an intelligent team where we can all learn from each other and improve how projects are made."
