  <h3>What?</h3><p>PythonFlow is an experimental community driven Python links site. Items are not added automatically, but chosen and summarized by community members, resulting in a better quality and context than <a href="http://python.reddit.com/">social bookmarking sites</a> can offer.</p>
  <h3>How?</h3><p>Enjoy the links, comment or <a href="/items/new">make a post</a> of your own. You don't need to be signed in!</p>
  <p><em>Note: If you're not signed in, your byline is unlinked and your links are made "nofollow" to prevent spam. You also get CAPTCHAed!</em></p>
