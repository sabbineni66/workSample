[{"content":"Introducing a new PHP micro-framework: Bullet. Bullet is a resource-oriented\nmicro PHP framework built around HTTP URIs. Bullet takes a unique functional-\nstyle approach to URL routing by parsing each path part independently and one\nat a time using nested closures. The path part callbacks are nested to produce\ndifferent responses and to follow and execute deeper paths as paths and\nparameters are matched.\n\nBullet makes it easier than ever to build REST APIs and other applications in PHP\nin a simple, concise, and straightforward manner with almost no learning curve\nand nearly unlimited flexibility.\n","format":null}]
