It is the fifth year in a row that the bicycle industry has sold more than one million units, a figure yet to be realised by car manufacturers.\n\nThe Cycling Promotion Fund (CPF) spokesman Ian Christie said Australians were increasingly using bicycles as an alternative to cars. Sales rose nine percent in 2006 while the car market stalled. Mr Christie said people were looking to cut their fuel costs and improve their fitness.\n\nMr Christie, a native of Hobart, Tasmania said organisations were beginning to supply bicycles as a company vehicle. \"There is an emerging trend towards people using bikes as their official company-supplied vehicle in place of the traditional company car,\" he said.\n\n\"Some of Australia's biggest corporations now have bicycle fleets, and when you add in government organisations, we now know of at least 50 organisations which operate fleets of bikes.\"\n\n\"Although the company bicycle is a long way from taking over from the company car, it's an important trend when you consider that nearly half of all cars sold are to company fleets.\"\n\nThe CPF claims most commutes to work are less than 5 kilometres (3 miles) making bicycle travel a viable alternative.\n\n</body></document>",
