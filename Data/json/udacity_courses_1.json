You will also learn about different monetization models, profit margins, KPIs, and customer acquisition and retention.   \n\n###Lesson 2: Monetization Strategies \nThey say nothing happens before you make your first dollar. This lesson takes a deep dive into monetization strategies for different platforms, covering freemium, subscription, eCommerce, and Ads across web, games, and native apps. You?ll learn about the tools startups use to implement these strategies and design a plan to execute a model for your own product. \n\n###Lesson 3: Implement a Monetization Plan\nMonetization strategies change over time as the user base grows and the product evolves. In this lesson, you will choose and tailor a monetization strategy for your product and learn how to set up tracking to monitor its effectiveness. Using Google Analytics and other tracking tools, you will begin closely following and iterating based on behavior reports, crashes, exceptions, and app speed. \n\n###Lesson 4: Optimize Your Model\nIn the final lesson, you will learn how to react and re-engage users if your monetization strategies don?t originally work. Through a case study with Nir Eyal, you will see how product and monetization are closely tied and how the Hooked Model can be used to optimize your strategy. \n\n###Case Study: Wufoo\nLearn how Kevin Hale got started with Wufoo (sold to SurveyMonkey).",

If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.\n\n### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons?\n\n Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you?re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I?m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively!

More specifically, we will talk about the projects we will build and the ideas we will learn in this course. Then we will conduct a short test to ensure you have all the prerequisites necessary for the course. Finally, we will work together to download Python on your computer.\n\n### Lesson 1: Using Functions (3.5 hours)\nWe will use functions (webbrowser.open and os.rename) from the Python Standard Library to build two projects in this lesson. After that we will present a scenario where using functions will not present a very elegant solution; this will illuminate the need for a new programming tool called Classes.\n\n### Lesson 2: Using Classes (5 hours)\nHere we will learn about important object-oriented programming concepts like classes and instances. We will build three cool projects while using classes. These include drawing shapes with Turtle, sending text messages with Twilio and checking curse words with a function called open.\n\nWe will leverage modules from within the Python Standard Library and also learn to download and use an external Python package (twilio).\n\n### Lesson 3: Making Classes (5 hours)\nIn this lesson we will learn to create our first class. While doing this we will build a website that plays trailers of your favorite movies. Here are some of the programming ideas we will learn in this lesson:\n\n- How to create a class\n- How to instantiate an object\n- How to access class attributes and methods \n- What is the self keyword\n- What are constructors (\\__init__)\n- What are DocStrings\n- How to create and access Class Variables\n- How does Inheritance work\n- How to override methods  \n\n### Final Project (6 hours)\nHere, you will use the skills learned in this course to identify a problem statement and idea for a project. You will then identify step-by step directions (in simple English) to design a solution for the previously identified problem. Finally, you will use this design and your newly learned object-oriented programming skills to write code to realize your project.",

      "faq": "Before course development started, we asked you what questions you had about Apple's Swift language. Here are the answers to your most burning questions:\n\n### Why is the language called Swift?\nThe language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. \n\n### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?\nSwift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you won?t miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.\n\n### How easy is Swift to learn?\nSwift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/\">According to Apple</a>, Swift is the ?first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.? Some have even <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186/\" target=\"_blank\">called Swift the new BASIC</a>.\n\n### Is it fast?\n<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple boasts</a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.\n\n### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?\nObjective-C has been Apple?s primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.\n\n### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?\nAbsolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.\n\n### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?\nAs mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show it?s age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.\n\n### How Stable is Swift?\nAs with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.\n\nThe thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17\" target=\"_blank\">failable initializers</a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655\" target=\"_blank\">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*</a>.\n\n### What other languages is it similar to?\nSwift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though you?ll also probably recognize some C syntax. \n\n### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?\nSwift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.",

      "syllabus": "As a student in the Machine Learning Nanodegree program, you will build the  projects listed below. Each project has a **supporting course**. Reviewers will provide feedback on your projects and guidance on how to take your project to the next level.\n\n*Note: Unless otherwise mentioned in the individual project descriptions, you will need to implement your projects in **Python 2.7**. Familiarity with numerical and scientific computing libraries like **NumPy** and **SciPy** will be very helpful.*\n\n###Project 0: Titanic Survival Exploration (Optional)\nIn this project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger?s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.\n\n***The supporting course covers:*** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\n\n###Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices\nYou want to be the best real estate agent out there. In order to compete with other agents in your area, you decide to use machine learning. You are going to use various statistical analysis tools to build the best model to predict the value of a given house. Your task is to find the best price your client can sell their house at. The best guess from a model is one that best generalizes the data.\n\n***The supporting course covers:***  Statistics Review & Supporting Libraries, Evaluating Model Performance, Model Evaluation & Validation, and Model Optimization.\n\n###Project 2: Building a Student Intervention System\nAs education has grown to rely more and more on technology, more and more data is available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities, grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more are now available in real time. Educators are after new ways to predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions, as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions. Toward that end, your goal is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam.\n\n***The supporting course covers:***  Supervised Learning Intro, Decision Trees, Regression, Neural Networks, Kernel Methods, Instance Based Learning, Bayesian Learning, Ensemble Learning.\n\n###Project 3: Creating Customer Segments\nMost of the data one collects doesn?t necessarily fit into nice, labeled categories. Many times not only is data not labeled, but categories are unknown! In this project we will take unstructured data, and then attempt to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. First you?ll learn about methods that are useful for dealing with data without labels, then you?ll apply this to a dataset of your choice, learning what natural categories sit inside it.\n\n***The supporting course covers:***   Clustering, Feature Scaling, Feature Selection, Feature Transformation, Semi-Supervised Learning.\n\n###Project 4: Train a Smartcab to Drive\nA smartcab is a self-driving car from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. In this project, you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive.\n\n***The supporting course covers:***  Markov Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning, and Game Theory.\n\n###Project 5: Capstone Project\nIn this capstone project, you will leverage what you?ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first **define** the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will **analyze** the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it. You will then **implement** your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect **results** about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct **conclusions** about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.

Players control a paddle that can move along the bottom of the screen and send balls toward a field of blocks.  \n\nYou can be creative and use your own design ideas, for example, you might want to add power-ups or allow the game to get progressively more difficult. Make sure to read and review the project rubric before submitting, however.\n\nPrepare for this project with: <a href=\"https://udacity.com/course/ud405\" target=\"_blank\">2D Game Development with libGDX</a> \n\n##Project 2: Space Kerfuffle\n\nSpace Kerfuffle is a top down, starfighter combat game.  Players assume the role of an intrepid spacefighter pilot flying headlong into a swarm of aliens or robots or something else evil that wants to destroy humanity, probably.  Players control a spacecraft and fire projectiles at oncoming enemies who do the same.  Explosions happen. Numbers go up.\n\nSee our prototype of the game for inspiration.  Note that your game doesn?t have to function exactly like this!  You can be creative and use your own design ideas.  Make sure to read and review the project rubric before submitting, however.\n\nPrepare for this project with: <a href=\"https://udacity.com/course/ud406\" target=\"_blank\">How to Make a Platformer Using libGDX</a>.\n\n## Project 3: Monetization\nBuild a monetization and engagement plan to hook and retain users in your game. Choose from interstitial ads, freemium models, and in-app purchases - selecting the model that fits best with your game. You'll also set goals and devise a plan for monitoring the success of your monetization strategy, as well as identify potential tweaks should the strategy not perform to your liking.\n\nPrepare for this project with: <a href=\"https://udacity.com/course/ud407\" target=\"_blank\">Engagement & Monetization | Mobile Games</a>\n\n## Project 4: Artificial Intelligence and 2D Game Physics \nOne way you can make a good game great is to make the gameplay more engaging. \n\nHaving objects that move about the world in a realistic manner thanks to the the physics library Box2D is great way to do so. \n\nIntelligent enemies that can actively search and navigate a map, strategically attack players, and apply AI algorithms also ratchets up playability. \n\nIn this project, you will make your game more realistic and immersive by using physics and AI algorithms. \n\n*Course coming soon!*\n\n## Project 5: Capstone Project\n\nFor the capstone project, you will create a game of your own design incorporating libGDX, physics and artificial intelligence and monetization. The sky's the limit for what you can build. We encourage you to begin on paper and deeply consider how you might monetize your app as it may dictate how you might implement some features.",

You will use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that will display on the resume.\n\nPrepare for this project with: [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) and [Intro to jQuery](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-jquery--ud245)\n\n### PROJECT Classic Arcade Game Clone\nYou will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game *Frogger*.\n\nPrepare for this project with: [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) and [HTML5 Canvas](https://www.udacity.com/course/html5-canvas--ud292)\n\n### PROJECT Website Optimization \nYou will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.\n\nPrepare for this project with: [Website Performance Optimization](https://www.udacity.com/course/website-performance-optimization--ud884) and [Browser Rendering Optimization](https://www.udacity.com/course/browser-rendering-optimization--ud860)\n\n### PROJECT Neighborhood Map\nYou will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you?d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).\n\nPrepare for this project with:  [Intro to AJAX](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110) and [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989)\n\n### PROJECT Feed Reader Testing\nIn this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

By the end, you?ll have an amazing prototype to share and a really insightful list of talking points for potential investors about the feedback from your UX research experiments.\n\nLearn prototyping skills with <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/rapid-prototyping--ud723\" target=\"_blank\">Rapid Prototyping</a>. \n\n###Marketing & Distribution Plan\nWith this project, you?re going to come up with a plan to acquire users and grow! By the time you?re done, you will have a robust marketing plan, which will also give you a lot of material for your final capstone project. Including a slide deck with a description of your value to your customers, how you stack up against competitors, who your target audience is, and how you plan to get distribution.\n\nGet ready for this project with <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/app-marketing--ud719\" target=\"_blank\">App Marketing</a>.\n\n###Your Story\nYou often only get one chance to tell someone (an investor, an accelerator, or a customer) about your business. This project will help you do that in a powerful, succinct way. This is the polished culmination of everything you?ve done and learned during the Tech Entrepreneur Nanodegree.

While learning  Python, you'll be developing a skill that's required for every programming project regardless of language: using procedural thinking to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do.\n\n\n### Be User-Friendly\nEven though *you* will have the skills to modify your web page by changing the code it's made from, the people you show it to may not. You'll add a form that allows visitors to add their own content to your page (if you let them of course). While you're learning what to do with information that someone submits to your web page, you'll also gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and how computer programmers assemble complex programs by combining pieces of computer code that others have written before them. \n\n## How You Will Learn to Build it\n\nThis Nanodegree consists of a series of 5 stages. In each one, you will learn new broadly-applicable technical skills. After each stage, you will complete a project checkpoint, then submit your work for valuable feedback on your progress.  \n\n### Stage 1: Make Your Web Page\nYou will learn the basics of how the internet works and how documents written in a language called HTML form the backbone of the Web. In the **project checkpoint** at the end you'll *write HTML and CSS (another language) to make your web page look professional.*\n\n### Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz\nThis is where you'll learn how to program. You'll learn a programming language called Python and you'll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this stage you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the **project checkpoint** you will *write a program in Python to build a fill-in-the blanks type quiz.*\n\n### Stage 3: Create a Movie Website\nIn this stage, you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the **project checkpoint** you will create a simple movies webpage with images and trailers.*\n\n### Stage 4: Allow Comments\nUp to this point, you still haven't put your web page online: you've only seen it on your own computer. In this stage, you will gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and will write code which tells computers called \"servers\" how to display web pages. In the **project checkpoint** you will *put your web page online and build what's called a \"back end\" which will allow people anywhere in the world to view and--if you let them--modify your site.*\n\n### Stage 5: Choose Your Next Steps\nAt this point, you will already have a solid understanding of most of the essential concepts and skills that programming requires. This stage will be a rapid sampling of some of the ideas that you haven't seen including:\n\n* **JavaScript**: the language of the web.\n* **APIs**: \"Application Programming Interfaces\" give programmers a way to easily incorporate data from all over the web into their applications.\n* **Recursion**: This may be the most mind-blowing idea in programming.\n* **Parallel Computing**: How to use many computers to solve really big problems more efficiently.\n* **How to Solve Big Problems**: You run into new challenges when you write large programs (or building substantial web pages). \n* **Responsive Web Design**: How to make your web page look good on a computer, tablet, or phone.\n\nIn the **project checkpoint** you will have the chance to *pursue one of these ideas even deeper by adding new functionality (you get to choose what) to your web page.*",
