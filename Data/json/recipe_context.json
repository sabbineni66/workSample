Variations may include toppings of tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, or cheese, a popular dish is Bruschetta pomodoro; the most popular recipe outside of Italy involves basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella.

  "html:preparation": "<h2>How to make Baby's Bruschetta</h2>\n<h3>Preparation</h3><p>Make the bruschetta mixture one day before the event and let it sit in the fridge overnight to absorb all the flavours(be aware your fridge will smell entirely like the <i>tomatoes</i> and <i>garlic</i></p><p>I find it works best to slice the <i>baguette</i> on an angle to create more space. Put the broiler on the oven on to toast the bread. Line them up on a baking sheet and make a small mixture of chopped garlic and olive oil to lightly spread on the slices of <i>baguette</i>, then place into the oven.</p><p>Once Half toasted remove bread and place bruschetta mixture on top (after draining off the majority of fluid). Then sprinkle the grated cheese on top and place back into the oven to broil/toast to your desired effect.  ~ Please note that if you prefer to not have your <i>cheese</i> melted you can skip this step and just toast the bread fully, add the mixture and <i>cheese</i> and serve.</p><p>Once melted, remove and place directly on a serving platter and let rest for one minute while adding fresh chopped *basil* for garnish, and <strong>ENJOY!</strong></p><h3>Variations</h3><ol><li>Use fresh oregano instead of basil.</li><li>Other possible toppings: prosciutto, salami, bean spreads</li></ol><h3>Notes</h3><ul><li>In <b>Italy</b>, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called <em>ventricina</em> is served.</li><li>In <strong>Tuscany</strong> it is called <em>fettunta</em> and it is usually served without toppings, especially in November, to taste the very first oil of the season.</li><li>The chinese translation of 'Bruschetta' is '????' (Google Translator)</li></ul>",
