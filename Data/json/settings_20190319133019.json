I can not imagine a living room without shelves of books.\n\nMost likly I inherited this passion from my grandfather, who owned over **4000** books. My books count roughly a  **1000**. I buy books ahead and my desks are always stuffed with unread books. I like classics, books about philosophy, martial arts, art &amp; desgin, architecture, typography and novels.\n\nWork-related books I read mostly digital, because they get old too fast and don?t look nice in most cases."

I collected knowledge about the history, arts, tools, weapons, philosophy and life of the Ninja."
