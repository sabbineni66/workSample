C&S is a great place for an outdoor meal with a fun menu. </li><li> Terrific lunch menu. I'm still dreaming of the golden brown toasted bread. They actually hit the perfect toasting balance. Wow. Salad was incredibly fresh and each leaf sprigg was robust. Dressing was a bit sparse but that's a personal preference. Sandwich was good, a wee bit too much cheese, but at least the cheese was flavorful. <font color=#60B2D0> Environment great for quick <b>business lunch</b>.</font> Ample parking. Friendly and attentive service. </li><li> The food is really good: well presented, good flavours, pleasure to eat. The ambience is great: trendy, industrial, vibrant. What let this place down for me was service. <font color=#60B2D0> It was slow (we came here for <b>business lunch</b>), quite brisk and impersonal.</font> We would have liked a warmer welcome and a bit more charisma. </li></ul>", "best_snippet": "...
