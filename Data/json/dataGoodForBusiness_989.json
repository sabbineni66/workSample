[{"reviews_with_mentions": "<ul><li> Directly across the street from Hilton Checkers Los Angeles. Nice neighborhood find. Great wine selection. <font color=#60B2D0> Easy to conduct a <b>business meeting</b>, eat dinner and enjoy some wine.</font> Excellent service provided. </li><li> First, the caveat. <font color=#60B2D0> I came here for a late <b>business lunch</b> (1:30) and we were a bit time constrained.</font> This impacted the ambiance, noise level, and possibly a tad the service, but NOT the food.  The Good: the food here is phenomenal. The constantly changing menu has a number of things that you've likely never even HEARD of, let alone had. The oyster selection is also likely the best in LA. Even the portions were relatively large for a place like this. Try the Clam Chowder, it'll surprise you.  The Bad: Very few bad's here.. the bread was relatively blah and the place was dead, but i'm stretching on finding any negatives.  Overall: Probably the best traditional seafood restaurant in LA. </li><li> <font color=#60B2D0> the staff couldn't have been more accommodating...a good <b>business lunch</b> spot</font>  </li><li> <font color=#60B2D0> I scheduled a <b>business lunch</b> at the Water Grill.</font> The food was amazing and the service was excellent. </li></ul>", "best_snippet": "...
